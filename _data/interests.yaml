first_paragraph: As a software engineering student, I have a keen interest in developing efficient and user-friendly software. I
  have completed coursework in object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms, and have experience
  with several programming languages including Java, PostgresSql, and JavaScript.

second_paragraph: Apart from being a software engineering student, I enjoy most of my time being indoors playing
  games and watching movies and television shows. I enjoy immersing myself in the worlds and stories provided by both
  mediums. I enjoy the interactive nature of gaming because it allows me to actively engage in the plot and make
  decisions that influence the ending. Watching movies, on the other hand, is a great method for me to unwind and
  temporarily escape into another world. I admire the inventive storytelling and visual effects that go into
  producing a film.
  I also have a passion for building and creating, that is why I have a strong interest in both Lego and Minecraft. 
  With LEGO, I enjoy the challenge of constructing complex models using a variety of different pieces. With Minecraft, 
  I enjoy the freedom of building in a virtual world, where I can let my imagination run wild and create whatever I want.
